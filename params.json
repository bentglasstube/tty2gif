{"name":"tty2gif","tagline":"record your scripts into a gif","body":"# Intro #\r\n\r\n`tty2gif` let you record scripts and their outputs into both binary and\r\ngif formats.  \r\n\r\nJust like the original `script`, `tty2gif` first pomp up a temporary\r\nshell where you can type in your shell commands. Meanwhile, `tty2gif`\r\nwill record both your inputs, and the output results. When you finish\r\nrecording, just execute `exit` in the temporary terminal. Finally,\r\n`tty2gif` will store all above information into a binary file, named\r\n`file.raw`. If you provide the second argument, named `out.gif`,\r\n`tty2gif` will replay recorded process, and convert the it into a gif\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\n`tty2gif` also can be used to convert an exist binary file into a gif\r\nanimation. Just feed it with an exist binary file name as the first\r\nargument, and the output gif file name as the second argument.\r\n\r\nUnlike other implementations, `tty2gif` provides a uniform solution\r\nwith a single simple C/C++ source file. I only tested it on Linux with\r\nBash. Feel free to report any bugs or port it into other systems, like\r\nBSD based systems.\r\n\r\nThe `script` function part is inspired by the code in the book:\r\n[The Linux Programming Interface](http://www.man7.org/tlpi/)\r\n\r\n# Usage #\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./tty2gif file.raw [out.gif] [delay(ms)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nfile.raw: output binary file name `OR` an exist binary script  \r\nout.gif: output gif animation file name  \r\ndelay: change speed in milliseconds for gif, e.x., +10 or -10\r\n\r\n# Install #\r\n\r\n`tty2gif` depends on the Magick++ library.  \r\nAfter that, just `make`\r\n\r\n# Demo #\r\n\r\n![gif](http://i.imgur.com/kjoNrBT.gif)\r\n\r\n# Contact #\r\n\r\nYoujie Zhou // [z24.me](http://z24.me)\r\n","google":"UA-6787765-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
