# Intro #

tty2gif let you record scripts and their outputs into both binary and
gif formats. I only tested it on Linux with Bash. Feel free to report
any bugs or port it into other systems, like BSD.

# Usage #

```sh
$ ./tty2gif file.raw [out.gif] [delay(ms)]
```

file.raw: output OR an exist binary script  
out.gif: output gif animation  
delay: change speed in milliseconds for gif, e.x., +10 or -10

# Install #

tty2gif depends on the Magick++ library.  
After that, just `make'
